# Diabetes Diagnostic Prediction System

This repository contains a machine learning-based diagnostic prediction system that aims to predict whether or not a patient has diabetes using a provided dataset.

## Overview:

- **Objective:** The primary objective of this project is to develop an accurate diagnostic tool for predicting the likelihood of a patient having diabetes based on relevant medical data.

- **Dataset:** https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database

## Key Features:

- **Data Preprocessing:** The system includes data preprocessing steps to clean and prepare the dataset for modeling.

- **Model Training:** We utilize the dataset to train and fine-tune a predictive model capable of making accurate diabetes predictions.

- **Evaluation Metrics:** We assess the model's performance using relevant evaluation metrics.

- **Predictive Interface (To Do):** Future plans include the development of an interactive user interface for users to input their medical data and receive predictions.
